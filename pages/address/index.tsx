        <p className="text-center">
          <strong>ideaSpace</strong> is a community of founders, innovators and investors in Cambridge. <br />
          <a href="https://ideaspace.cam.ac.uk/"><strong>ideaSpace City</strong></a> is a co-working space in the heart of Cambridge, where the Hack Cambridge Foundation is based. <br />
          It is located in the centre of Cambridge, close to the train station and the city's main attractions. <br />
        </p>
        <p className="text-center py-4">
          Hack Cambridge was founded in 2016 by students at the University of Cambridge at ideaSpace. <br />
          Since then, it has grown into a charity that runs events and programmes to inspire young people to explore technology. <br />
          The foundation is run by a team of volunteers who are passionate about technology and education. <br />
          We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about technology, regardless of their background. <br />
          If you would like to get involved, please get in touch. <br />
